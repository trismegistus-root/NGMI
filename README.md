### Purpose  
Originally, this project was meant to be a collectible token for anonymous crypto communities. NGMI token was
supposed to have a total supply of 100. However, in light of recent investing circumstances from those
communities, it is possible that these communities will be deplatformed. It is only a matter of time. 
The purpose of this project is to keep those communities together while maintaining anonymity. 

### How it works  
Currently, Replatform Token (Symbol: NGMI) is the only available token. Simply visit the faucet, 
request a token, pay the gas fee, and boom - you're in, kid. Ultimately, different communities will
be able to govern their own token through use of a mother token (ERC721) that permits access to
pause functions within an ERC20. 

### The point  
Having a Replatform Token in your ether wallet will permit access to a backup server for anonymous communities. 
An oracle will be used to detect a permanent 404 on certain communities. At that point, the dApp will launch
a verified-only platform for that community, pausing all minting functions until the community requests it 
to be otherwise.
